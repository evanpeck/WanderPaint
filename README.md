# WanderPaint

A simple interactive program that creates abstract visuals that are driven by a person's mouse and mic. Uses [p5js](https://p5js.org/). A working demo can be viewed on my website: <https://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/p5/wanderPaint/>.

## Commands

- Mouse placement on the screen determines biases the speed and direction of the paint.
- Mic levels are mapped to the thickness of the paint brush (or splatter).
- Space bar clears the screen
- Clicking randomly changes paint color.
- `s` will save and download .jpg of the canvas
